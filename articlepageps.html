                    Adobe Photoshop, the industry-leading raster graphics editor, has long been synonymous with photo
                    editing. Its comprehensive suite of tools and features has made it the go-to choice for
                    photographers, graphic designers, and digital artists worldwide. However, Photoshop's capabilities
                    extend far beyond mere photo manipulation, offering a vast array of tools for video editing, 3D
                    design, and web development. While its photo editing prowess is undeniable, Photoshop's true
                    potential remains underutilized by many, limiting its impact on various creative and professional
                    endeavors.

                <p class="article-content">
                    Photoshop's video editing capabilities often go unnoticed, overshadowed by its reputation as a photo
                    editor. However, Photoshop offers a powerful set of tools for creating and refining video content.
                    Its timeline-based interface, non-destructive editing workflow, and extensive array of filters and
                    effects make it a versatile tool for video editing tasks ranging from basic trimming and color
                    correction to complex compositing and motion graphics.

                <p class="article-content">
                    Photoshop's 3D capabilities, though discontinued in recent versions, have enabled the creation of
                    stunning 3D graphics and animations. While the discontinuation of native 3D support may have
                    disappointed some users, Photoshop remains a valuable tool for 3D artists, particularly for texture
                    creation, painting, and rendering. Its compatibility with external 3D modeling software allows for a
                    seamless workflow, integrating 3D elements into Photoshop projects.

                    Photoshop's role in web development extends beyond mere image optimization. Its ability to create
                    and edit web graphics, such as icons, buttons, and navigation bars, is invaluable for web designers.
                    Additionally, Photoshop's prototyping tools allow for creating interactive mockups of websites,
                    enabling designers to visualize and refine their designs before development.
